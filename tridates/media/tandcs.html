            <h2>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>15. The majority of content posted in tri-dates.com communities is created by members of the public. The views expressed are theirs and unless specifically stated are not those of Tri Dates. Tri Dates is not responsible for any content posted by members of the public on tri-dates.com or for the availability or content of any third party sites that are accessible through tri-dates.com. Any links to third party websites from tri-dates.com do not amount to any endorsement of that site by Tri Dates and any use of that site by you is at your own risk.</p>
            <p>16. tri-dates.com content, including the information, names, images, pictures, logos and icons regarding or relating to Tri Dates, its products and services (or to third party products and services), is provided "AS IS" and on an "AS AVAILABLE" basis. To the extent permitted by law, Tri Dates excludes all representations and warranties (whether express or implied by law), including the implied warranties of satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, compatibility, security and accuracy. Tri Dates does not  guarantee the timeliness, completeness or performance of the website or any of the content. While we try to ensure that all content provided by Tri Dates is correct at the time of publication no responsibility is accepted by or on behalf of Tri Dates for any errors, omissions or inaccurate content on the website. </p>
            <p>17. Nothing in these terms limits or excludes Tri Dates' liability for death or personal injury caused by its proven negligence. Subject to the previous sentence, Tri Dates shall not be liable for any of the following losses or damage (whether such damage or losses were foreseen, foreseeable, known or otherwise): (a) loss of data; (b) loss of revenue or anticipated profits; (c) loss of business; (d) loss of opportunity; (e) loss of goodwill or injury to reputation; (f) losses suffered by third parties; or (g) any indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages arising from the use of tri-dates.com regardless of the form of action. </p>
            <p>18. Tri Dates does not warrant that functions available on tri-dates.com will be uninterrupted or error free, that defects will be corrected, or that tri-dates.com or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or bugs. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to implement sufficient procedures and virus checks (including anti-virus and other security checks) to satisfy your particular requirements for the accuracy of data input and output.</p>

            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>19. If any of these terms are determined to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by reason of the laws of any state or country in which these terms are intended to be effective, then to the extent and within the jurisdiction in which that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from these terms and the remaining terms shall survive and continue to be binding and enforceable.</p>
            <p>20. The failure or delay of Tri Dates to exercise or enforce any right in these terms does not waive Tri Dates' right to enforce that right. </p>
            <p>21. These terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes.</p>
